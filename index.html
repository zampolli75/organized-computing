					Introduction
				</h2>
				<p>Proficiency with Information Technology (IT) is a MUST for <i>any professional in any discipline</i>. You are enrolled in college because you want to become a knowledge worker: "A person whose occupation is predominantly concerned with generating or interpreting information, as contrasted with manual labor."<a data-toggle="tooltip" href="http://www.webster-dictionary.org/definition/knowledge%20worker" target="_blank" title="http://www.webster-dictionary.org/definition/knowledge%20worker"><sup>1</sup></a> Knowledge workers in any profession, from researchers in labs, to journalists on the front lines, to nurses in hospitals, leverage computers and digital technology to improve their productivity and the quality of their work. If you are in the college of business, you know that Information Technology has, over the last thirty years, revolutionized every aspect of business, from Accounting to Strategy.</p>
				<p>As Steve Jobs – the co-founder of Apple, Inc. – observed in 1990<a data-toggle="tooltip" href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/12/21/steve-jobs-bicycle-for-the-mind-1990" target="_blank" title="https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/12/21/steve-jobs-bicycle-for-the-mind-1990"><sup>2</sup></a>: “the computer is the most remarkable tool that we have ever come up with. It is the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.”</p>

				<p>What he meant is that just like a person on a bicycle can go further and go faster than a person walking, a computer can help your mind work faster and go further than you would achieve alone. As a knowledge worker you will be doing most of your work with your mind.</p>
				<p>Your goal in this course is to take advantage, rather than being hurt, by the continuing shift toward the digitization of work. If you successfully complete the course you will become what we call a <i>sophisticated end-user</i>. In four months you will be a savvy knowledge worker by developing expertise in three distinct but related domains: Practical <i>computing skills</i>, foundational <i>information technology</i> concepts, and foundational <i>information systems</i> concepts. This class is your chance to learn to ride the "bicycle of the mind" effectively and efficiently.</p>

					Description
				</h2>
				<p>The practical computing skills portion of this course focuses specifically on accomplishing intermediate and advanced competences in Microsoft Excel. Excel is designed to create and manage spreadsheets. The first good reason to apply yourself in this course, is that mastery of spreadsheets will help you get a job. Consider just one statistic from a <a href="http://www.burning-glass.com/wp-content/uploads/Digital_Edge_report_2017_final.pdf" target="_blank">recent report</a> by the research firm <a href="https://www.burning-glass.com/" target="_blank">Burning Glass Technologies</a>: More than 8 in 10 middle-skill jobs (82%) require digital skills, a 4% increase since 2015: Spreadsheets and word processing remain the baseline for digital skills, with 78% of middle-skill jobs calling for these... at a minimum.
				</p>

				<p>Microsoft Office applications are used in this class. It is legitimate for you to ask why. The reason is simple, Microsoft Office dominates the market, and it has been doing so for over 27 years (see Figure 1)<a data-toggle="tooltip" href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/2225614/microsoft-subnet/office-2003-is-a-bigger-threat-to-microsoft-than-google-docs.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.networkworld.com/article/2225614/microsoft-subnet/office-2003-is-a-bigger-threat-to-microsoft-than-google-docs.html"><sup>3</sup></a>. Put it another way, the probability that when you get your first internship or your first job your company will use Microsoft Office is overwhelming. If you need to make an immediate impact as a knowledge worker in that organization, Microsoft Office is the application that you want to master. What you will learn in this course will help you be more efficient and effective in all your future classes and throughout your career. It is clearly in your best interest to take the course seriously!</p>

				<p></p>
				<p>Not convinced yet? Here is another reason. Microsoft Excel is not only widely adopted in organizations across the world, but is is also an example of <i>commercial off-the-shelf</i> software. The designation “commercial off-the-shelf” (COTS) refers to software and hardware products that, unlike custom-developed applications, are readily available for purchase to the public. Historically software was literally available “off-the-shelf” of a retail store (see Figure 2).</p>

				<figure class="figure">
				<img class="img-responsive" src="https://tempfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/cots.png" alt="Off the shelf software">
				<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><i>Figure 2: Commercial off the shelf software</i></figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p></p>

				<p>Today the name has remained but you will generally download the COTS software you need from a major app store or the vendor’s own website.</p>
				<p>COTS software, by its very nature, is designed to appeal to the largest possible audience of users. That means that in the case of Excel, Microsoft has invested millions of men-hours to create the widest possible array of functionalities in these applications over the years. Microsoft Office applications, like Excel, are relatively simple to learn and use. But they are also <i>very powerful</i>. However, most users only utilize a tiny fraction of these functionalities – by some estimates just 5 commands (paste, save, copy, undo, bold) account for 32% of the total commands used!<a data-toggle="tooltip" href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jensenh/2006/04/07/no-distaste-for-paste-why-the-ui-part-7/" target="_blank" title="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jensenh/2006/04/07/no-distaste-for-paste-why-the-ui-part-7/"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
				<p>Read this fascinating story about <a href="http://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2017/11/13/remove-the-legend" target="new">the central role Microsoft Excel played at Amazon</a>. The story is entertaining and you see how important a young analyst with Excel skills can be to a company. This could be you in a couple of years! </p>
<p>
				There is even one guy who is famous for his Microsoft Excel paintings!

				</div>
				<p></p>
				<p>Few users have the luxury to engage in advanced training (you should consider yourself lucky to have to take this class).  Thus, even the limited functionality they utilize they typically have learned from their colleagues or friends.  It is a well-known fact that <i>vicarious learning</i> of software, as it is formally called, is substandard. Imitation breeds bad habits. Like a game of Telephone<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="As you know in the game of Telephone the first player whispers a story in the ear of the person next to them sitting in a circle. The recipient repeats the story to the person next to them in the circle, and so on until everyone had an opportunity to screw up – I mean, repeat – the story. The result is a generally hilariously different story from the original when the two are read aloud side by side."><sup>5</sup></a> bad habits get compounded as friends teach each other down the line. Telephone is funny, but being inefficient in using the instrument with which you do your work is not that funny! If you apply yourself in this class you will not be hostage to the deleterious dynamics of vicarious software learning. You have the opportunity to learn intermediate and advanced features of Excel and you have the opportunity to learn directly from an expert source. Mastery is what this course offers, rather than mimicry. Take advantage!</p>
				<p>Not convinced yet? Here is another reason. This may be one of the courses with the highest payoff in your whole college career. As a knowledge worker you will spend most of your time collecting, processing, and disseminating information. In this class you will learn about 100 skills, and you will learn to be efficient in how you perform tasks that require these skills (i.e., you will perform these tasks more efficiently than you would have if you did not take the class). The typical knowledge worker spends 25 hours a week in front of the computer. If 20% of this time is spent working in Microsoft Office and you can save 40% of the time you would take without this class, over a 30-year career your time savings amount to 17,472 hours, or 728 days, or 104 weeks… that’s exactly two years! Assume that you take your work seriously, and you spend 10 hours a week on the practical computing skills portion of the course, your return on the investment is 145 hours in savings for every hour of work. And, by the way, our computation above does not include second order effects. That is, if you take this course seriously you will be better equipped to learn other software applications that we don’t explicitly cover in class (e.g., Microsoft Power Point). You will also develop some general knowledge about efficient and effective computer use that will apply to any computing work you will do in the future.</p>
				<p>In the remainder of this document we discuss the level of prior knowledge we assume you have, the basic mechanics for being proficient in this class, general expectations and our suggestions for being successful in learning the material in this course.</p>
				</div>				

				<div id="assumptions">
				<h2 class="hasAnchor">
					<a href="#assumptions" class="anchor"></a>
					Assumptions
				</h2>
				<p>There are two basic assumptions underpinning our design of the <i>practical computing skills</i> portion of the course:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>You understand basic computing concepts</li>
					<li>You have basic computing skills</li>
					<li>You have the commitment and competence to use online resources to self-learn</li>
				</ol>

				<h3 class="hasAnchor">
					<a href="#basic-concepts" class="anchor"></a>
					Basic Concepts
				</h3>
				<p>There are a number of basic concepts that represent the required vocabulary of any sophisticated end-user. They are briefly introduced below and you should master them, if you have not already.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>File</b>: In a computer systems a file is a data resource, available to system users, that is capable of being manipulated as an entity. When you delete an embarassing Instagram picture from your iPad, you are acting as a system user who is manipulating a file. But system users include the system itself (e.g., the operating system of your smartphone) and its application programs. The type of manipulations performed on a file include moving, copying, deleting, etc. 
						<p>
							There are two major classes of files: data files and program files. A data file, such as that embarassing Instagram picture you were trying to delete earlier, is a file that holds data to be used by an application. A data file does not instruct the computer on how to perform a task, but simply serves as a repository of “information.” Conversely, a program file contains the instructions, or steps, the computer needs to perform a tasks. Microsoft Excel is a program file. 
						</p>
					</li>
					<li><b>Metadata</b>: Data that provides information about other data is called metadata. Thus, the role of metadata is to be a descriptor for other data. You are certainly familiar with file extensions like .docx (for Microsoft Word files) or .xlsx (for Microsoft Excel files). File extensions are a good example of metadata. They serve the purpose of describing the type of file to the operating system so that the operating system can associate the correct application to it. In personal computers, extensions are usually three letters, but this is not a requirement.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Directory</b>: A file system, like the one on your personal computer, must be able to reference all the files it contains. How else could you manipulate them after all? Directories, also called folders, are those structures in your file system which contain references to other computer files. Directories (or folders) can be logically nested, in which case they are called subdirectories (or subfolders). Finally, the term "working directory" refers to the currently active directory, the one in which the system user is currently operating.
					</li>
					<li><b>Volume</b> (or logical drive): A single accessible storage area with a single file system. A typical computer system can have both internal and external volumes. The best example of an internal volume is the solid state drive (SSD) of your smartphone. It is the storage area that your smartphone uses to save the operating system, applications and data. However, many of you also use external volumes for backup or simply becacuse you have so much stuff on your phone that you run out of space on your internal volume. Apple iCloud or Google Drive are examples of external volumes.</li>
					<li>
						<b>File Path</b>: A string of characters, or other symbolic representation, that specifies the exact location of a file in a volume. While this definition sounds intimidating, you use file paths all the time. The last time you had to save a file that a friend shared with you, you had to specify the file path for the file system to know how to reference the location to store and later retreive the file. An absolute file path specifies the location of the file starting from the volume. A relative file path specifies the location of the file relative to the current working directory.
					</li>
					<li><b>Alias (or shortcut)</b>: Sometimes it is useful to create small files that represents, or point to, objects in a volume. These are called alias in Mac OS and shortcuts in Microsoft Windows. The objects that the alias refers to are any objects in the file system, like a file, directory, subdirectory, etc..
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>File structure</b>: A file structure captures the way your files are organized in your computer system. The two major types are the hierarchical and tag structures. The hierarchical structure organizes files using the metaphore of a cabinet. A cabinet has drawers that contain folders which in turn contain individual files. If a file is in one folder, it cannot be in another folder at the same time. This is the most common file structure. A tag structure organizes files by labeling them. Thus, a file can have multiple labels at the same time.
					</li>
				</ul>

					Basic Skills
				</h3>
				<p>You have been using computers for the majority of your life. Therefore, there are a number of important computer skills that we assume you have already mastered. We list them below, if you don’t feel comfortable with any of these make sure that you acquire them immediately.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You have some prior knowledge with Microsoft Office applications in general and with Word and Excel specifically. While our learning material starts from the very basics of each applications, we assume you already know how to create a basic Word Document and Excel Worksheet. We also take it as given that you can quickly self-learn any of the basic skills that you may be missing.</li>
					<li>You are able to use your prior knowledge of computing to navigate the small potential differences that can occur between available instructions and the specifics of your application. Software programs are deceptively complex. They have thousands of features and functionalities. Your specific application may have some special configurations or customization. We assume that these minor inconsistencies will not stop you cold in your tracks. We take it as given that you can either navigate these differences independently or seek appropriate help to correct them.</li>
					<li>You have the basic file management skills of a functional computer user. Specifically, you know how to organize your files in meaningful storage hierarchies that make it easy to find them, and you know how to use conventional and intuitive naming conversions for them. You understand the role of <i>file extensions</i>, and you can manage them appropriately.</li>
					<li>You understand the importance of saving your work and backing up your files. Specifically, we take it as given that during a working session (e.g., completing your homework) you remember to save after completing any substantive task. This is because you understand that <i>primary memory is volatile</i> and that computers can, and do, freeze from time to time. Thus, were the computer to lose power for any reason, your unsaved work would be lost. We also take it as given that you appreciate the importance of backups, whether on peripherals (e.g., a USB drive) or remotely (e.g., on a cloud service like Dropbox). This is because you understand that <i>secondary storage devices</i> are subject to equipment failure. Albeit rare, when equipment failure happens it can be very costly. Thus, the appropriate risk management strategy is to develop sound backup practices. In the case of this course you should have at least two separate copies of each important file <i>at all times</i>.</li>
					<li>You have basic time management skills and you know how to successfully organize your work. One day you will be a manager, which means you will be responsible for organizing the work and efforts of your employees, in some cases, hundreds or even thousands of them. At this stage in your professional life you are very lucky, all you have to do is organize your own self. We take it as given that you can do so. If you find yourself unable to do so reach out to us immediately.</li>
					<li>If any of the above assumptions is not correct in your specific case, or if any of the terms and concepts we refer to in the above section is foreign to you, it is <i>your responsibility</i> to contact a teaching assistant as early as possible and remedy your current skill deficiency.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="hasAnchor">
					<a href="#pedagogical-approach" class="anchor"></a>
					Our Pedagogical Approach: The Flipped Classroom
				</h3>
				<p>Practical computing skills are widely distributed amongst the population of students in this class. Some of you have considerable experience with Microsoft Office and may have taken formal courses in high school. Sometimes these courses are fairly advanced. Many of you have limited knowledge of Excel, knowledge that comes from independently working in the application and learning from friends.</p>
				<p>With such a variety of skills in the course the <i>flipped classroom</i> is the optimal approach to ensure a high degree of sophistication of all participants by the end of the course, while maintaining peak efficiency for each of you. The flipped classroom concept prescribes that high-quality self-directed learning modules be made available to the learners, along with target learning outcomes and a schedule of achievement expectations.</p>
				<p>Armed with these three tools each of you can organize the learning schedule as needed, depending on your prior knowledge. If you are already very advanced you could skim the materials to make sure that you do know it and that you are aware of the many different approaches available in the application to perform the same task. Doing so enables you to verify that you have not picked up any bad habits and inefficient approaches in your previous experiences. If you are new to the application or the particular set of skills required to perform the week’s tasks, you should allocate significant time to review and practice the available material.  Some words of caution and suggestions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>For as advanced as you may be, chances are you can learn quite a bit from the material in this course. There are often many ways to perform the same task in software applications. Reviewing the materials may show you new approaches that make you even more effective and efficient.</li>
					<li>As mentioned above, you may be able to perform the task while being completely unaware that, because of vicarious learning, you picked up your friends’ bad habits. Thus, while you could complete the homework without reviewing the material, you may be nowhere near as efficient as you should be. This inefficiency will be very costly during the exam, where you are required to complete many tasks under time constraint. More importantly, these bad habits will hold you back in your career, where efficiency is a premium skill of the modern knowledge worker.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The ability to organize your learning is a great advantage also for those of you that come to the course without a strong background in Microsoft Excel.  The material is available to you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You can repeat a unit as many times as you need, and you can return to the material while you complete the homework.</p>
				<p>Of course, while we have high quality self-directed learning material available to you, we are here to enable your learning. But as you can see from this design of our pedagogy, there is one big assumption behind our approach: That you are a <i>mature adult, conscious of the investment of time and money you are making in your education</i>. We count on you to realize that you are doing homework for yourself, not for us.  We are eager and happy to help you, but you are in charge and responsible for your own success.</p>

					<a href="#basic-mechanics" class="anchor"></a>
					Basis Mechanics
				</h2>
				<h3 class="hasAnchor">
					<a href="#microsoft-office" class="anchor"></a>
					Microsoft Office
				</h3>
				<p>We require that in this course you use the most recent version of Microsoft Office for your operating system. It is furthermore required to update the software release, so check for available updates before the first Microsoft Office session. Using the same release and version will provide consistent software across all computers in the classroom, preventing us to deal with bugs or errors unique to some releases.</p>
				<p>LSU provides you with free license for Microsoft Office by virtue of your LSU enrollment. Following the instructions on the <a href="https://software.grok.lsu.edu/Article.aspx?articleid=17762" target="_blank">Tigerware website</a> you will be able to get your license and install Microsoft Office (IMPORTANT: you must chose a version under RECOMMENDED VERSION). If it’s the first time you visit Tigerware, you will notice that you have available other free licensed software as well. We suggest you to go through the available software as you might find some tools that might boost your productivity during your career at LSU (e.g. citation management, project management tools).</p>
				<h3 class="hasAnchor">
					<a href="#defending-viruses" class="anchor"></a>
					Defending from Viruses
				</h3>
				<p>The files present in your computer are the outcome of many hours of your effort. It is your duty to have the right security on your computer to protect such valuable assets. There is a plethora of different virus and other malware categories, each of which excels in causing damage (e.g. deleting files, making programs crash unexpectedly, stealing information, slowing down the performance of your machine).</p>
				<p>We will discuss malware and computer security in the course. At this stage however it is critical that you make sure your computer is protected. LSU provides you with a free license for Symantec Protection and other useful software to secure your computer. You can download it from <a href="https://tigerware.lsu.edu/Browse?CategoryId=53&PageSize=20&PageIndex=1" target="_blank">Tigerware</a>.</p>
				<p>On Tigerware you also have free access to the Cisco VPN client, which will allows you to connect to the LSU network remotely. Using publicly accessible Wi-Fi hotspots, such as the ones you find in coffee shops or airports, is as dangerous as surfing dubious websites without any antivirus. Connecting to the LSU network through the VPN will make your connection secure. Connecting to the LSU network when off campus provides you with other benefits, such as accessing journals, newspapers, and resources that LSU grants to its members.</p>
				
				<h3 class="hasAnchor">
					<a href="#defending-viruses" class="anchor"></a>
					Naming Convetions and Backups
				</h3>
				<p>
					When organizing your files it is a good habit to have a standard naming convention. That is, you should get used to naming files according to a set of rules that you apply consistently. Doing so will save you time and reduce the chance of you losing valauble assets. When creating a naming convention, keep in mind these suggestions:
					<ul>
							<li>Be descriptive but succinct</li>
							<li>Be consistent in applying the naming convention</li>
							<li>Avoid special characters (e.g., %, &, @)</li>
							<li>When creating versions of your file use a consistent versioning approach such as appending a date (e.g., filename_20170824), or a version number (e.g., filename_v2.3).</li>
						</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Modern computer systems have a lot of storage space. For this reason you should maintain multiple copies of your files by creating versions as needed. When you do so:
					<ul>
							<li>Be descriptive but succinct</li>
							<li>Be consistent in applying the naming convention</li>
							<li>Avoid special characters (e.g., %, &, @)</li>
						</ul>
				</p>

				<p>We advise you to back up your files to protect your work from unnecessary loss. We suggest two main options:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>External Hard Drives: A flash drive or a hard disk offers the simplest option to create an entire back up of your computer. Both Windows and Mac users have system default programs that will allow you to create backups easily. Furthermore, you might want to schedule automatic backups so you can free your mind from having to remember to do it periodically.</li>
					<li>Cloud: Increasingly, there are free and commercial services to store your files and backups “in the cloud.” We will discuss “the cloud” in class during the course. For now, think of it as a flash drive located remotely and accessible via the Internet. Services such as Microsoft One Drive, Google Drive, Dropbox, or Apple iCloud are amongst the most popular. Installing the desktop version of these cloud services will provide you with automatic sync and backup of your files.</li>
									</ol>
					<p>When thinking about your backup strategy, keep in mind these suggestions:
						<ul>
							<li>Isolate your data from system files</li>
							<li>Design a storage system that is easy to move</li>
							<li>Use a continuous backup system, not a manual system</li>
							<li>Use a remote backup (e.g., cloud) if possible</li>
							<li>Add a local backup using an external volume</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<a href="#setting-yourself" class="anchor"></a>
					Final Remarks
				</h2>
				<p>Do not take this course lightly. Allow yourself time (at least an hour) each day to go over the materials available to you. Experiment with the features and see how different applications address similar tasks. You will soon find that you are able to do much more with your skills than just “word process” or “data entry”. You will learn HOW, WHEN, and WHERE to use the software available to you to its fullest potential. This is your opportunity to take time to understand how computers behave; to TEACH YOURSELF and be comfortable at figuring out a computer problem on your own. Such abilities will take you very far in the business world.</p>
